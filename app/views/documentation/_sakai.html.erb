    <p><strong>Video Reserves:</strong> A new tool has been made available to your Sakai course called <strong>Video Reserves</strong>. You can add this feature to your course through the Sakai Site Editor, go to the Edit Tools, and select Video Reserves. Save your tool selections, and the tool appear on the left navigation bar.</p>
    <p><strong>All other reserves:</strong> Once your reserves are prepared, you will be given a direct link to your course reserves in the old reserves system. You can add a generic <strong>Web Content</strong> tool to your course and paste the direct link there so that your students can easily access your reserves list from within Sakai. This will include all reserves except streaming video. Please remember that we will be transitioning to the new unified reserves system following Fall Break 2013. After that, you will have access to a single tool in Sakai called <strong>Library Reserves</strong> which will include all of your course reserves.</p>
    <p><strong>Questions?</strong> Please contact the library or the OIT Help Desk (<a href="mailto:oithelp@nd.edu">oithelp@nd.edu</a>) if you have any questions about reserves or how to access them within Sakai.</p>

    <p>Library reserves is currently in a state of transition. We're streamlining our workflow and processes to make it easier for students and faculty to set up and request reserves. Because of this, access to reserves within Sakai requires one method for video reserves, and another for all other reserves until <strong>Fall Break 2013</strong>. Following fall break, reservse will be unified, and there will be one simple method by which you will be able to access and use reserves within Sakai.</p>
    <p><strong>Video Reserves:</strong> An instructor for the course has access to a new tool called "Video Reserves" which they can add to their Sakai course. This tool will provide automated access to all digitized videos the professor has requested.</p>
    <p><strong>All other reserves:</strong> The instructor for the course will be given a web link pointing directly to their reserves in the old reserves system. This can be used to create a generic web tool within Sakai in order to provide easy access to the remainder of your course reserves.</p>
